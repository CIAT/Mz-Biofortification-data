The main objective behind this tool is to compile and document agronomic datasets obtained from biofortified maize crop. This will help to locate at a glance where agronomic biofortification of maize has been or is currentlt being done in East and South Africa region.  

## Data
Currently, the compiled dataset is sourced from a survey carried out under [Africa Rising project](https://africa-rising.net/) in Babati district Tanzania. The original data is available here online and can be downloaded as a csv file for further analysis and should be cited as: [insert citation format here].  
The dataset will keep on growing when new records become available either from historical data or collected from the field.
